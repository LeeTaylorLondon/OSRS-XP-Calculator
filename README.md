# OSRS-XP-Calculator
Small side project. Input current level or xp, target level, name of skill (optional), XP per hour, and hours per day.
Number of hours and days needed to reach target level is outputted.  

There are examples of using the provided functions in the main.py file. The formulae to calculate XP for a level 
is from the OSRS wiki. 

I made this to calculate the number of days I needed to stay in nightmare zone. This works with all other skills 
not just combat skills.
